        "summary": "It's our role to stop the weapons: we know that *70%* of Israel's genocide has been paid for by U.S. tax dollars, and both the policymakers *and* the profiteers of genocide live & work here in the United States. When the masses of people coalesce around strategic campaigns against mega-corporations, we transform the economic outlook of apartheid Israel, pressuring the powerful to cut ties with genocide.\nJoin us to learn about a series of strategic BDS campaigns for companies, institutions, and governments to cut ties with genocide, called the People's Arms Embargo. We can win, like the movement for divestment from South African apartheid before us, but first we need to win campaigns that politically and economically isolate corporations that send weapons to Israel.\n--Hear from Aisha with Palestinian Youth Movement's Mask Off Maersk campaign and Honor the Earth about taking on the underbelly of imperialism: the logistics company Maersk that is responsible for shipping weapons and military goods to the Israeli Ministry of Defense\n--Learn from Adan from New Orleans Stop Helping Israel's Ports (NOSHIP) about how to get started with identifying local Maersk sites and demanding the company cut ties with genocide\n--Get inspired by and plug into the Chevron: Stop Fueling Genocide campaign to use boycott and divestment to pressure Chevron to divest from extracting fuel for Israel from fields off the coast of Palestine.",

        "excerpt": "What's most astonishing is how naturally married women can blend such affairs into their lives.",
        "summary": "A married woman cheating. (Courtesy)\nBaltasar Ebang Engonga, the powerful Director General of Equatorial Guinea's National Financial Investigation Agency (Anif), has turned global attention on the secret lives of married-but-available women after being linked to over 400 affairs with married women.\nIt's a revelation that raises more than eyebrows\u2014it shines a light on a side of relationships often whispered about, but rarely acknowledged: the quiet, covert, and surprisingly organised lives of married women who step outside their unions. It's safe to say that were it not for that fraud investigation, these married women would never have been discovered by their husbands.\nLet's be honest\u2014infidelity has never been strictly a man's game, but for a long time, men's dalliances have hogged the spotlight. Society almost expects it, laughing at the 'wandering eye' as an intrinsic male trait. Men, after all, have been famously unfaithful for centuries, from kings with their mistresses to politicians and pop stars with affairs splashed across tabloids. But a lesser-known side to this story exists. Women, too, have picked up on these playbook tactics\u2014and might even be playing the game better.\nIn contrast to the all-too-common bungling or public discovery of male affairs, the married-but-available woman operates under a strict set of covert tactics that allow her to lead a dual life with near invisibility. These women know exactly how to slip through the cracks, mastering the fine art of discretion with almost CIA-level expertise.\nWhat's most astonishing is how naturally married women can blend such affairs into their lives. Many of them understand that the key to discretion lies in simplicity. Their 'extracurricular activities' are seamlessly tucked into their day-to-day. The extra 'lunchtime yoga class' becomes code for a rendezvous, or that occasional 'girls' weekend' is a perfect alibi. And it works. Men, after all, often overlook the subtle signals or explain them away as quirks.\nWhen it comes to communication, modern technology has made the art of the affair more convenient, but women have found that discretion is about discipline. There's little impulsive texting or risque messages during family hours. Instead, many stick to predictable times or anonymous chat apps that leave no trail, disappearing like digital ghosts before suspicion even has a chance to settle.\nStudies have shown that women often cheat for more complex reasons than men. Emotional neglect, a lack of intimacy, or just feeling unappreciated in their marriages can lead them to find validation outside the relationship. Unlike men, who often pursue affairs for variety or thrill, women tend to be more discerning about their partners in infidelity. The married-but-available woman may be choosy, often seeking someone who understands her situation and respects the delicacy of her dual life. She isn't necessarily seeking a lifelong partner or a replacement for her husband\u2014she's looking for connection, excitement, or validation.\nA common misconception about infidelity is that it's an act of cold-hearted betrayal, but these women are often deeply attached to their families. They know the stakes and make concerted efforts to avoid letting their actions interfere with family life. As many psychologists argue, some women use these affairs as a way to preserve their marriages rather than destroy them. It's paradoxical, but some say that the escape provided by a discreet affair lets them return home with renewed patience or energy.\nThe truth is, women have mastered the art of balance. They remember birthdays, their partners' schedules, handle parenting issues, and manage to make space for their dalliances\u2014all without setting off alarms. The result? Husbands rarely suspect anything. And herein lies the humor and irony. Men, often quick to boast about their infidelities, frequently miss the signals when the tables are turned. While they assume their wives are simply 'too busy' or 'just not the type', these women often glide under the radar, preserving the sanctity of their secret world.",

        "summary": "A businesswoman doing breathing exercises in her office. (Courtesy)\nBreathing exercises may sound simple, but are powerful tools for improving both your physical and mental well-being. Research shows that these techniques can reduce stress, improve lung capacity, and even support heart health.\nAccording to the American Lung Association, breathing typically feels easy when our lungs are healthy, as the diaphragm does most of the work of pulling in fresh oxygen and releasing waste gases.\nHowever, targeted breathing exercises can make this process even more efficient.\nHere are five benefits of regular breathing exercises: Reduce stress and anxiety\nDeep breathing slows the heart rate and activates the body's relaxation response, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) notes that slow, deep breaths can lower cortisol, the body's stress hormone. Improve lung capacity\nBreathing exercises engage respiratory muscles including the diaphragm, hence helping the lungs to expand more efficiently. Diaphragmatic breathing, for example, is highly effective for lung health. According to the American Heart Association, this can help reduce respiratory effort and improve oxygen intake, enhancing your stamina and lung function over time. Lower blood pressure\nFor heart health, breathing exercises are incredibly beneficial. The American Heart Association states that slow, rhythmic breathing can dilate blood vessels, improving circulation and reducing blood pressure. Alternating nostril breathing is one great way to regulate blood pressure. Regular practice may lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. Enhance digestion\nStress can interfere with digestion, causing issues like bloating or constipation. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) explains that stress management, including breathing exercises, can support digestion by lowering cortisol levels, which often disrupt normal digestive function. Abdominal breathing can reduce stress hormones, improve nutrient absorption and help ease digestive discomfort. Improve mental clarity\nFinally, breathing exercises can also sharpen focus and mental clarity. The '5-5-5 method' (inhale for five counts, hold for five, exhale for five) helps oxygenate the brain and clear mental fog. The National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health notes that slow, deliberate breathing can bring calmness, enabling better focus and reducing distractions.",

WISH is a global healthcare community dedicated to capturing and disseminating the best evidence-based ideas and practices.\nIn December 2023, following discussions between Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation and WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus, WISH and WHO established a strategic partnership, formalising a longstanding relationship between the two organizations, building on a track record of impact and reflecting joint resolve to focus attention on solving pressing global health challenges.\nOver two days, more than 2,000 health policy makers, innovators, entrepreneurs, researchers and practitioners will convene at the Qatar National Convention Centre to look for innovative solutions to some of the world's biggest health challenges. The theme of this year's summit is 'Humanizing Health: Conflict, Equity and Resilience' and will highlight the need for progress in health to support everyone, leaving nobody behind and building resilience, especially among vulnerable societies and in areas of armed conflict.\nWISH and WHO are collaborating to create a series of evidence-based reports and policy papers that will be released at WISH. The reports aim to provide policy recommendations for innovative, practical solutions to strengthen people-centred health systems that can provide equitable, accessible and quality health for all individuals, families and their communities. The WHO-led reports, featured within plenary sessions, focus on elimination of tuberculosis, the growing importance of palliative care, and protecting health in armed conflict.\nReflecting the importance of translating research into practical solutions, additional sessions will be structured around WHO-led policy papers on community engagement and indigenous health, women's cancers in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and women in the health and care workforce in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.\nWithin the overall theme, November's global gathering will feature four 'tracks', categorizing sessions into sub-themes:\nHealth and armed conflict, covering pain management, disability, hunger and mental health\nHealth of vulnerable and minority populations, considering TB in refugees and migrants and palliative care\nSystem level innovation and change, such as antimicrobial resistance and the ethics of AI in health\nCommunity-led engagement and interventions, including obesity and women's cancers in the region\nThe biennial meeting will feature more than 200 experts in health speaking about evidence-based ideas and practices in healthcare innovation to address the world's most urgent global health challenges.",

        "summary": "The climate crisis is a health crisis - and progress on children's health globally is in danger of being reversed.\nA lack of progress in reducing emissions and building adaptive capacity threatens both human lives, the human right to health and the viability of national health systems. Additionally, the same human activities that are destabilizing the Earth's climate also contribute directly to poor health. Children have unique vulnerabilities that make them more susceptible, directly and indirectly, to climate-related hazards compared to other populations: they breath more rapidly, they have poorer thermal regulation, and their bodily systems shaping their immunity and cognitive function are still developing.\nAt COP29 in Azerbaijan, WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF's Deputy Executive Director Kitty van der Heijden will be hosting a dialogue along with passionate leaders from government, public and private sectors, and youth groups to explore the health argument for climate action, why it should always center its focus on maternal, newborn and child populations globally, and how child and youth can contribute to informing critical climate and health policies, advocacy, and progress.\nThis High-Level Party Event in a VVIP area (Zone D) requires a ticket to enter. Please send your RSVP to Marina Maiero (maierom@who.int) and Abheet Solomon (asolomon@unicef.org).\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease note that this event can only be attended in person in Zone B (Blue Zone) at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.

The book set to be launched on November, coincides with her 50th birthday, hence the hashtag #The5thAt50.\nThe book, whose title is still under wraps, will be published by Mvua Press, an imprint of E-kitabu.\nCiku pushes boundaries by humanising the so-called pariahs of the society, by basing her love stories on them. In her books, prostitutes, as well as former criminals, have fallen in love.\nWith her fifth book, Ciku pushes the boundaries a bit further by writing a crime-romance novel.\n'It is the underground Nairobi, its residents and, does love even live there? Among the protagonists is a crime boss, two undercover cops, a priest, a brothel madam and, you guessed it, a prostitute,' she says.\nThe launch will be a fun-filled event, she says.\n'There shall be music, and food, and drinks and a live performance,' she adds.\nHer other books are Nairobi Cocktail, Immigrant Cocktail, Cocktail from the Savannah and A Cocktail of Unlikely Tales.

In 2021, pneumonia claimed the lives of 2.2 million, including 502,000 children, and COVID-19 killed an additional 10 million, according to the Global Burden of Disease. Together, they caused more deaths than any other cause, including heart disease. With climate change continuing to increase the burden of respiratory conditions and the risk of another pandemic of respiratory infection high, there is a pneumonia crisis across the life course placing millions at risk of infection and death.\nTragically, it is the very young and the very old who are at greatest risk. Children living in areas with low vaccination rates and rising malnutrition, and in homes that use polluting fuels for cooking and heating, are particularly vulnerable. Older adults exposed to outdoor air pollution \u2013 most significantly from burning fossil fuels \u2013 and smoking are also at risk. Almost half of the estimated 1.5 million pneumonia deaths among adults aged over 50 are attributable to air pollution and smoking.",

        "excerpt": "Ann Vanlauwe: Living for charity",
        "summary": "Dr Ann Vanlauwe receive gift hampers from Janet Mathenge (left) of Gift Basket Kenya. [Jonah Onyango, Standard]\nBorn in Nigeria and married to a Belgian national, Ann Vanlauwe is a unique woman making it big in Kenya, now her home. Commanding power and authority in her various leadership roles, she remains an influential leader, a far cry from the humble orphan she was growing up. Now, she can have it all.\nWhen she moved with her family in 2001, Ann says she immediately fell in love with Kenya.\n'I was born to Ibo parents in Owerri, Imo State, Eastern Nigeria, and I am a wife and the doting mother to two children, a 30-year-old son who lives in Ireland, and a daughter, who is 27 and who lives in Brussels,' says Ann, painting a picture of a happy mother witnessing her children living their dream life.\n'As a mother, I think parenting is one of the most beautiful things that I have experienced. The most important thing is to get the foundation right and then allow them to find their route,' she says.\nShe adds that it has been an amazing journey of parenting with her husband, Belgian national Benard Vanlauwe, who she met while in university.\n'Bernard was a young soil scientist and agricultural agronomist. He was in Nigeria at the time, collecting data at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan for his Ph.D.'\nThe two got married and lived together at IITA, an institution populated by scientists from all over the world. He later worked for IITA as a soil scientist after completing his Ph.D.\n'It was here that my talent as a social activist struck my peers, and they elected me president of the African ladies' group, bringing together women at the institution from all over Africa for two years,' she says.\nAnn's commitment to social responsibilities received a wider boost when she was elected Vice-President of a larger organization comprising women from the rest of the world living with their spouses or working at IITA for a two-year stint.\nActivities were on a larger scale but similar to those at the African Women's group. They moved to Kenya in 2001 because her husband had decided to form and run an IITA branch in Kenya.\nAnn, who gave up employment and decided to take care of her children, says the void grew when the children were older and had to pursue their interests in different countries.\n'My husband also travels a lot. Previously, it was a bit difficult, but in life you can't eat your cake and have it. He has to provide for us, so we live together in Nairobi, but we spend two or three weeks, and then he travels again', she says.\nWhen the family moved to Nairobi, Ann, who confesses her obsession for charity joined the Rotary Club of Nairobi.\n'Two years into my membership, the club made me the director of the family of rotary with duties that involved organising functions that bring together members and their families. They included fellowships, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and visits to the sick and the bereaved,' she says.\nIn 2011, Ann was elected director of community service, where she oversaw projects such as the securing of wheelchairs for the physically challenged and sanitary towels for needy girls. The following year, she became the 83rd president and the third black African woman president of the Rotary Club of Nairobi, which dates back to 1930. It is the oldest in East Africa.\n'It was an amazing moment for me. The club had prominent people like Manu Chandaria. I took it as an honour and decided to give it my best shot.'\nLike it was yesterday, she recalls the challenges she had to face growing up as she appreciates that her sister and her brother-in-law saw her through primary and secondary schools in Yoruba land. She later attended the University of Ibadan for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in African studies.\n'At only three, I lost my mother, four years later, I lost my father, prompting my elder sister, who was married in Yoruba-dominated Ibadan in the South, to take me into her care,' she says.\nWith the first degree safely in her grip, Ann enrolled for a Masters course in community development and education at the same university. It was at this time that she developed a stronger passion for social advocacy and the promotion of community welfare.\n'We were not rich, but we had food to eat. Her husband also understood us. I called him Dad. I am who I am today because of them. I saw how well they treated me and other people. My sister was so selfless, and I hope I'm making her proud today as I help people', she says.\nIn 2007, Ann founded Better Life For Women and Children in Rural Africa; a family-centered Not-for-profit Organization that champions for the welfare of orphans and vulnerable children.\n'It is in rural areas that you find the most vulnerable people, so we aim at transforming the lives of women in absolute poverty to be self-reliant. We do distribute sanitary towels to schools where girls have difficulties accessing them to do challenges from the backgrounds. The teachers in these schools tell us that the girls are performing better in school after receiving the sanitary towels and that alone gives me satisfaction,' Ann says.\nDuring one of her visits to mixed schools in Narok County, Ann realised that she had focused so much on the girls, and the boys were feeling left out. She then decided to come up with a hygiene kit for boys.\n'Now we also give hygiene kits to boys that consist of a bar Soap, bathing soap, roll-ons, towels, and toothpaste. So far, we have done more than 500 hygiene kits for boys.', she says.\nIn Narok County alone, Ann and her organisation have helped more than one thousand families since 2019.\n'When COVID-19 struck, many families who depended on tourism to eat were affected. We decided to give them foodstuff to sustain them for at least four months.'\nLast year, Ann introduced free medical camps starting in Kilifi County, where people went through medical checkups, diagnoses, treatments, and referrals where necessary.\n'Many healthcare centers in rural areas do not have enough medication. We plan to take the next medical camp in Sekenani in April 2025', she said.\nIn 2018, she founded Hope for African Children in Ibadan, Oyo state. The NGO caters to widows and orphans in rural Nigeria. Every year, Ann visits these women and children with necessities and daily supplies.\n'I love Kenya so much, but I decided not to be a foreigner in my own country. I decided to help the widows who have little children, and they don't know where their next meal will come from.'\nAnn adds that while she can't cure all their problems, some food can give them strength to face the next day.\n'We have three centers where we give them supplies. We have more than 300 widows, and we need a lot of money to cater for them. I'm currently planning something for Christmas so they can enjoy the season with their families', she says..\n'Each one of us can do something to help the less fortunate. Don't do it only once in December. The children's homes need food throughout the year', she says.\nHer parting shot is a quote by the late Mother Teresa: 'Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love.'",

        "summary": "Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a challenging complication in liver cirrhosis, with no currently available sensitive diagnostic markers. This study aimed to investigate the potential of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) as diagnostic indicators for PVT in chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related decompensated cirrhosis. Methods\nWe analyzed 145 CHB-related decompensated cirrhosis patients from the Ditan study and 33 from the Changgung validation study, categorizing them based on PVT occurrence. Plasma samples were assessed for NET markers, including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and histone-DNA complexes, along with DNase activity. Results\nPVT patients exhibited elevated levels of cfDNA and histone-DNA complexes, and reduced DNase activity. This pattern persisted regardless of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) status. Histone-DNA levels, DNase activity, and hemoglobin were identified as independent risk factors for PVT. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that high histone-DNA levels may serve as a potential diagnostic marker for PVT, with an area under the curve of 0.8628 in the Ditan study and 0.7521 in the Changgung study. When combined with cfDNA and DNase activity, the area under the curve improved to 0.8774 in the Ditan study and 0.7975 in the Changgung study. Conclusions\nImbalances in NET homeostasis are associated with PVT in CHB-related decompensated cirrhosis, including cases involving HCC. Histone-DNA complexes, a significant risk factor for PVT, show potential as a diagnostic marker for PVT in decompensated cirrhosis, particularly in HBV-related HCC.\nFull text\nhttps://www.xiahepublishing.com/2310-8819/JCTH-2024-00165\nThe study was recently published in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology .\nThe Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology (JCTH) is owned by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and published by XIA & HE Publishing Inc.

USAID first introduced the Mission Civilian-Military Coordinator (MC2) position in 2017 to align essential humanitarian and development programming with our colleagues at DoD. We now have 120 MC2s across our Missions and Country Offices worldwide, helping DoD and USAID work together to coordinate crisis response and advance development goals.\nIn Djibouti, for instance, USAID and DoD worked together to support primary education - with DOD rehabilitating 80 percent of the country's primary schools in areas outside the capital, and USAID then providing hundreds of thousands of teaching and learning materials to these schools to help children learn to read - helping to increase the percentage of second graders reading at a minimum level of proficiency from 20 to 46 percent. In Vietnam, DoD and USAID are working to overcome the legacy of war by coordinating the remediation of soil contaminated with dioxin, the toxic chemical byproduct of Agent Orange. Veterans have been essential in both identifying opportunities for collaborations like these and bringing together teams across Agencies to make them happen.",

        "summary": "Bacteria frequently encounter adverse environmental conditions, such as nutrient scarcity and antibiotic exposure, which can induce DNA damage. Efficient DNA repair mechanisms are essential for bacterial survival, particularly under such stress conditions. A critical player in these processes is the signaling molecule (p)ppGpp, a phosphorylated guanosine synthesized by bacteria during periods of stress. Initially discovered in Escherichia coli under amino acid starvation, (p)ppGpp is now recognized for its broader roles in modulating cellular functions essential for DNA repair and stress response. By regulating diverse cellular processes, (p)ppGpp not only enables bacterial adaptation but also enhances their ability to survive in the presence of DNA-damaging agents like fluoroquinolone antibiotics, contributing significantly to antibiotic resistance mechanisms. This review explores the role of (p)ppGpp in DNA repair pathways, stress-induced mutagenesis, and bacterial persistence.\n(p)ppGpp's Regulatory Role in DNA Repair\nNucleotide Excision Repair (NER) and RNA Polymerase Interaction\nOne of the most significant DNA repair pathways influenced by (p)ppGpp is nucleotide excision repair (NER), responsible for addressing bulky DNA lesions such as those caused by UV radiation. Within NER, two pathways exist: global genomic NER and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), both of which remove lesions by initiating RNA polymerase stalling at damaged sites. (p)ppGpp binds to RNA polymerase, promoting its backtracking and the recruitment of repair proteins to damaged DNA sites, which is critical for TC-NER efficiency. Studies have shown that (p)ppGpp acts alongside other transcription factors, such as DksA, to modulate transcription in response to stress, ensuring that resources are reallocated to essential repair functions. The combined action of (p)ppGpp and RNA polymerase in stalling and backtracking serves as a checkpoint, allowing DNA lesions to be recognized and excised by the NER machinery. Furthermore, this regulatory function aids bacteria in adapting to various stress conditions by ensuring genomic stability, a prerequisite for bacterial persistence and growth under adverse conditions.\nDownregulation of Mismatch Repair and Stress-Induced Mutagenesis\nMismatch repair (MMR) is another pathway that (p)ppGpp influences by regulating key repair proteins, including MutS and MutH, which are responsible for correcting replication errors and base mismatches. Under nutrient-limited or stationary phase conditions, (p)ppGpp downregulates MMR proteins, potentially favoring mutagenesis. This downregulation, combined with the upregulation of error-prone polymerases, allows bacteria to accumulate adaptive mutations that can increase their survival chances under antibiotic pressure. For instance, (p)ppGpp promotes the production of alternative sigma factors, such as sigma S, which triggers a general stress response that favors the transcription of error-prone polymerases over high-fidelity ones. This regulatory shift enhances the probability of mutations, contributing to bacterial adaptation and persistence in the presence of antibiotics, albeit at the cost of genomic stability.\nRole in Recombinational Repair and Double-Strand Break Repair\nRecombinational repair mechanisms are critical for managing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that arise during replication or antibiotic-induced stress. (p)ppGpp, through its interaction with RNA polymerase, aids in managing replication conflicts and facilitates the loading of repair proteins such as RecA onto single-stranded DNA, an essential step in recombinational repair. Additionally, (p)ppGpp-mediated stalling of RNA polymerase at DSBs enables repair machinery like RecBCD and RuvABC to resolve DNA breaks. This process allows bacteria to not only survive but also continue replicating even under stress conditions. Notably, stress-induced mutagenesis associated with DSB repair can also lead to antibiotic resistance, as the repair process incorporates mutations that confer survival advantages. Through these pathways, (p)ppGpp provides bacteria with a toolkit to repair severe DNA damage while also facilitating genetic diversity within bacterial populations, thereby enhancing adaptation to environmental challenges.\nThe SOS Response: Linking (p)ppGpp to DNA Damage-Induced Survival\nThe SOS response, a bacterial stress response to DNA damage, is tightly regulated by (p)ppGpp. Activation of the SOS response is initiated by RecA upon detection of DNA damage, leading to LexA repressor cleavage and subsequent expression of DNA repair genes. In conditions such as UV exposure or fluoroquinolone treatment, (p)ppGpp enhances the SOS response by regulating the transcription of repair proteins and sigma factors essential for DNA repair. For example, (p)ppGpp binding to RNA polymerase facilitates transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage, promoting expression of error-prone polymerases involved in translesion synthesis. These polymerases allow the replication machinery to bypass DNA lesions, albeit at the risk of incorporating mutations. This process not only enables bacteria to survive acute DNA damage but also supports mutagenesis under antibiotic stress, contributing to resistance development. Thus, (p)ppGpp's involvement in the SOS response positions it as a central regulator of DNA repair and mutagenesis in bacteria.\nStress-Induced Mutagenesis and Persistence in Fluoroquinolone Presence\nA key aspect of (p)ppGpp's function in antibiotic resistance is its role in stress-induced mutagenesis, which aids bacterial survival under sublethal antibiotic concentrations. (p)ppGpp downregulates MMR and other high-fidelity repair pathways, promoting the use of error-prone polymerases and facilitating mutagenesis. In fluoroquinolone-treated bacterial populations, specific subpopulations, termed \"gamblers,\" exhibit heightened mutagenesis, enhancing survival under antibiotic pressure. Fluorescent cell sorting has identified that these gambler cells exhibit an active stress response, which includes increased mutation rates. Furthermore, (p)ppGpp and associated sigma factors help sustain these mutations by inhibiting mismatch repair and facilitating repair processes that increase bacterial tolerance to antibiotics. This survival mechanism, though detrimental to genomic integrity, promotes adaptive evolution within bacterial populations, allowing some cells to survive and develop resistance under antibiotic stress.\nAntibiotic Persistence and the Role of (p)ppGpp in Bacterial \"Persisters\" and \"Gamblers\"\nBeyond mutagenesis, (p)ppGpp contributes to bacterial persistence, enabling a subpopulation of cells to survive antibiotic treatment without acquiring genetic mutations. In minimal inhibitory concentrations of fluoroquinolones, persister cells exhibit a phenotype that enables survival through metabolic dormancy and stress response activation. Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, induces this persister state by causing membrane depolarization, a response mediated by the toxin HokB in E. coli. The conserved GTPase protein Obg, which is regulated by (p)ppGpp, is essential for this persistence mechanism. By regulating proteins that maintain cellular dormancy and membrane stability, (p)ppGpp supports bacterial cells in surviving antibiotic exposure and contributes to recurrent infections. This mechanism, combined with the mutagenesis observed in gambler cells, creates a dual strategy where bacterial populations are equipped with both mutational adaptability and persistence, allowing them to endure varying antibiotic concentrations and environmental stresses.\nConclusions\nThe signaling molecule (p)ppGpp plays an indispensable role in bacterial DNA repair and survival strategies under stress. By modulating DNA repair pathways such as NER, MMR, and recombinational repair, (p)ppGpp aids in preserving genomic stability in the short term while also facilitating long-term adaptation through stress-induced mutagenesis. These functions, particularly in response to antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, underscore the significance of (p)ppGpp as a master regulator that bridges DNA repair with bacterial survival and antibiotic resistance. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms offers promising insights into combating antibiotic resistance by potentially targeting (p)ppGpp-mediated pathways, paving the way for more effective treatments against persistent and resistant bacterial infections.

His name is William Deere and he sends misinformation to members of Congress on a regular basis. So, you can be sure that they are very concerned that there's going to be budget cuts in various areas and also a general attitude that will not be deferential to the UN.\nThe current administration, which you know, differed from the UN on a number of things, and the Biden administration did vote for Israel on most occasions. Not all, but most occasions. But the attitude always was admiring of the UN and even cheerleading.\nSo, even the Human Rights Council, which is a horrific body that is made up of 60% dictatorships and other forms of non-democracies: we're talking about the Chinese Communist Party, the Qataris who support the Taliban and Hamas, Eritrea which has slave labor, the Cuban police state which has, hundreds of teenage political prisoners. They're members of the Human Rights Council.\nAnd the attitude, sadly of the Biden administration, although they did try to introduce positive action on some instances, although they did oppose the anti-Israel measures, the general tone was, 'we love the UN human rights system. They're amazing.' And cheerleading.\nThat's going to stop.\nAnd the UN isn't only the UN bodies. There's also the whole environment around it. The ecosystem includes NGOs, certainly in New York and Geneva. There's the whole Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. They're very much part of the UN ecosystem.\nThe current administration has legitimized them even though they support a lot of radical policies. Certainly they've been an asset of Hamas in the past year and an asset of Hezbollah.\nThat kind of glorifying will stop.",

        "summary": "End-of-Mission press releases include statements of IMF staff teams that convey preliminary findings after a visit to a country. The views expressed in this statement are those of the IMF staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF's Executive Board. Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that, subject to management approval, will be presented to the IMF's Executive Board for discussion and decision. IMF Staff and Nigerien Authorities have reached an agreement at the staff level on the sixth review of Niger's economic program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and the second review under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) and conducted discussions on the 2024 Article IV consultation.\nThe economic outlook is favorable over the near term, with growth projected at 8.8 percent this year, driven by oil exports, the lifting of sanctions, and a good agricultural season. But this positive outlook is subject to downside risks.\nThe authorities' ongoing efforts to simplify the tax system and adopt an oil revenue management strategy are key reforms to create fiscal space to address development spending needs.\nWashington, DC: An International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff team led by Mr. Antonio David held meetings from October 28 to November 9, 2024, on the sixth review of the agreement with Niger under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and the second review of the arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) and conducted discussions on the 2024 Article IV Consultation.\nAt the end of the mission, Mr. David issued the following statement:\n\"The Nigerien authorities and the IMF team reached a staff-level agreement on the sixth review of Niger's economic program under the Extended Credit Facility, on the second review of the arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility and the 2024 Article IV consultation. The staff-level agreement is subject to IMF Management and Executive Board approval. The Board meeting is expected to take place in December 2024. The ECF review's completion would allow the disbursement of SDR 13.16 million (about US$ 17.4 million, or 10 percent of Niger's quota) to cover external financing needs. In turn, completion of the second review of the RSF would allow for the disbursement of SDR 25.66 million (about US$ 34 million, or 19.5 percent of Niger's quota).\n\"Despite a delicate context stemming from factors such as the humanitarian and material effects of the recent floods, liquidity tensions in the banking sector, and tight financing conditions; economic activity is expected to strongly recover this year. Growth is projected at 8.8 percent in 2024, mainly driven by oil exports, a favorable agricultural season, and the lifting of sanctions. Economic activity is expected to remain robust next year, with growth reaching 7.9 percent, while inflation should recede to 3.7 percent. However, risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside. A deteriorating security situation could further impact economic activity, while fiscal space may shrink if regional financing conditions continue to tighten. Additional external risks include commodity price volatility and the economic fallout of escalating regional conflicts (such as tensions in the Middle East).\n\"The arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility aims to strengthen macroeconomic stability and lay the foundations for resilient, inclusive, and private sector-led growth. There were deviations from certain fiscal targets under the program at end-June and end-September 2024, notably concerning tax revenues and the accumulation of debt service arrears. Nonetheless, the Nigerien authorities are taking steps to address them. The authorities have also reaffirmed their commitment to meet the WAEMU criterion of an overall fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2025. The implementation of reforms to simplify the tax system, broaden the tax base, and adopt an oil revenue management strategy is on track. These efforts will contribute to create fiscal space to address development spending needs.\n\"RSF financing supports efforts to advance reforms and investments to address rising risks and challenges associated with climate change, thereby building resilience and safeguarding livelihoods. The Nigerien authorities made significant progress in implementing reforms aiming at tracking climate-related expenditures, analyzing fiscal risks linked to natural disasters, and incorporating climate-aspects in the assessment of public investment projects.\n\"The mission also engaged in discussions with the authorities on macroeconomic policies to increase Niger's resilience. Discussions focused on the efficient use of the country's natural resources, expanding fiscal space, managing fiscal risks, strengthening the private sector's contribution to growth, as well as enhancing transparency and anti-corruption measures.\n\"The mission met his Excellency Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy and Finance, Mr. Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine. The mission also held working sessions with the Deputy Minister of the Economy and Finance, Mr. Moumouni Boubacar Saidou, the National Director of the BCEAO, Mr. Maman Laouali Abdou Rafa, as well as other senior government officials, private sector representatives, civil society, and development partners.\n\"The IMF team wishes to thank the authorities for their excellent cooperation and constructive discussions during the mission.\"",

        "summary": "A new AI-based software has been developed that can be integrated with an ultrasound device to 'guide' childbirth by providing precise, real-time information on the baby's head position. It can clearly indicate to operators\u2014using a traffic light system\u2014whether to proceed with a natural descent in the birth canal, whether to use a vacuum extractor, or even if an emergency cesarean is needed.\nThis tool, which could be available in delivery rooms starting in 2028, was developed and validated as part of a study published in The European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology and coordinated by Professor Tullio Ghi, who is now full professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the Catholic University of Rome and Director of the Obstetrics Unit at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. The project received technical support from the Clinical Physiology Institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Lecce and colleagues from the Obstetrics Clinic at the University of Parma. The multicenter study was conducted as part of the ISLANDS international study group (International Study Group on Labor and Delivery Sonography), founded by Prof. Ghi, and will now proceed with a new prospective study selected by the Italian Ministry of Health among nationally significant projects (PRIN), funded with approximately 200,000 euros.\nThe journey of the fetus through the birth canal can be fraught with obstacles and risks. Fetal malposition\u2014a condition where the fetus's occiput is oriented toward the sacrum rather than the mother's pubic bone\u2014is among the most common causes of prolonged or halted labor progression. Depending on how the baby's head is positioned during descent, it may be necessary to use a vacuum extractor to facilitate delivery or, in more difficult cases, to resort to an emergency cesarean to ensure a safe delivery for both mother and child.\nAssessing the baby's head position can be challenging, even for experienced practitioners, Professor Ghi explains. When practitioners make evaluations by using hands, there is a one-in-five chance of error, which could lead to incorrect placement of the vacuum extractor, resulting in failed extraction, prolonged labor, and, in the worst cases, delayed delivery of a baby in distress. Ultrasound helps doctors accurately assess head position before using a vacuum extractor, but not all delivery room operators are able to use ultrasound effectively to obtain precise information.\nThe AI-based software uses ultrasound images to provide precise, real-time responses to operators, displaying the 'verdict' as a traffic light: red if it is not appropriate to proceed with the vacuum and an emergency cesarean should be considered; green if it is safe to proceed with the vacuum; and yellow if the situation is uncertain.\nIn the multicenter study, the software has been validated so far using 2,154 ultrasound images from 16 centers worldwide. The overall performance of the model in classifying fetal head position was excellent, Professor Ghi says, with an overall accuracy of 94.5% and a sensitivity of 95.6% (ability to detect head malposition).\nProfessor Ghi notes: \"We have developed an AI model applied to ultrasound that can automatically assess fetal head position during childbirth within a fraction of a second, with excellent overall accuracy\". \"In future we will validate our model on large patient populations before it can be introduced into routine clinical practice, but we believe that if results remain positive, the software could become part of clinical practice within 3-4 years,\" he concludes.",

The programme helps charities by supporting and advising trustees who find it hard to spend their income, recruit new trustees, identify beneficiaries, or find time to run the charity.\nGood causes, community foundations and charities across Wales have received a collective total of \u00a310,361,324 since the programme started in 2021. With help from the programme, 72 charities that were inactive are now operating again.\nWhen a charity cannot continue but has unspent funds, the regulator helps trustees to identify a charity or charities with similar purposes that can use the funds as intended. Those who cannot identify a suitable charity, can transfer funds to Community Foundation Wales. The regulator has overseen a total of \u00a31,522,068 transferred to Community Foundation Wales.\nMarking this milestone, Charity Commission Chief Executive David Holdsworth visited Dinas Powys Voluntary Concern - a recipient of Community Foundation funding. For over 50 years, the charity has worked with the local community to enable the elderly and people with limited mobility to maintain their independence, providing services such as transport to the local medical centre, wellbeing services and a soup lunch programme. After receiving a grant, the charity has expanded its wellbeing garden. David Holdsworth, Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, said:\nIt's important that every penny of charitable funds goes where intended. It's great to be in Wales again, seeing for myself the impact of our Revitalising Trusts programme. We've now distributed over \u00a310 million of dormant funds and by continuing to work with Community Foundation Wales, the Welsh government and trustees, I'm confident we can make even more of a positive difference to people and communities across the country. I encourage anyone working with a charity that has fallen inactive to reach out to us. Richard Williams, Chief Executive of Community Foundation Wales, said:\nIn these challenging economic times, small charities and trusts continue to play a crucial role in meeting the urgent needs of communities across Wales.\nWe are proud to have supported the Charity Commission, through the Revitalising Trusts programme, to unlock over \u00a310 million of unused charitable funds to help support people across Wales.\nWe recognise that trustees are concerned about inactive funds, and we are here to support them in adjusting charitable purposes or releasing these funds to communities in need.\nAs a result of this support, Community Foundation Wales has been able to invest in more Welsh communities so they continue to benefit, as was originally intended, from these funds. Notes:\nThe Charity Commission is the independent, non-ministerial government department that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales. Its ambition is to be an expert regulator that is fair, balanced, and independent so that charity can thrive. This ambition will help to create and sustain an environment where charities further build public trust and ultimately fulfil their essential role in enhancing lives and strengthening society.",

        "summary": "Scientists Uncover Vital Role of Maternal Small RNAs in Plant Breeding\nPlant breeders, aiming to develop resilient and high-quality crops, often cross plants from different species to transfer desirable traits. However, they frequently encounter a major obstacle: hybrid seed failure. This reproductive barrier often prevents closely related species from producing viable seeds. A new study from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology offers insights into this challenge by identifying small RNA molecules as crucial players in this process. These findings could pave the way for more successful hybridization in the future.\nViable seeds produced by Capsella orientalis on the left side and collapsed, non-viable seeds produced by crossing Capsella orientalis with its near relative Capsella rubella. A lack of maternal small RNA was found responsible for this discrepancy in seed quality.\n\u00a9 Katarzyna Dziasek Viable seeds produced by Capsella orientalis on the left side and collapsed, non-viable seeds produced by crossing Capsella orientalis with its near relative Capsella rubella. A lack of maternal small RNA was found responsible for this discrepancy in seed quality.\nWhen hybrid seeds fail to develop, the reason often lies in the endosperm-a tissue in plant seeds that provides nutrients to the growing embryo, much like the placenta nourishes mammalian embryos. Without proper development of the endosperm, the seeds cannot survive. A new study led by Prof. Dr. Claudia K\u00f6hler's research group has made a key discovery in the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard, broccoli, rapeseed, and other important crops. The study reveals a strong link between hybrid seed failure and a deficiency in maternal small RNAs. These tiny molecules are transferred from the maternal plant to the endosperm and control gene activity in the endosperm. When the gene expression in a seed is abnormal, seed development halts, ultimately leading to its death.\n\"Our findings suggest that the dosage of maternally provided small RNAs can determine whether a hybrid seed will grow or not,\" said Katarzyna Dziasek, the study's lead author. \"By controlling the levels of these RNA molecules, we may be able to improve the survival of hybrid seeds and overcome the barriers that have long prevented successful breeding between different plant species.\"\nInterestingly, this mechanism extends beyond plants. A similar phenomenon known as hybrid dysgenesis occurs in fruit flies. In this case, small RNAs from the mother protect against genetic disorders that can occur if the father's genetic material deviates too much. Thus, in both plants and animals, maternal small RNAs play a pivotal role in determining species compatibility in hybridization. Key questions remain about how these small RNAs are generated and transferred from the maternal plant to the endosperm, which are currently under investigation in Claudia K\u00f6hler's lab at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology.\nAs plant breeders continue to face the challenges of hybrid seed failure, this research provides a promising new avenue for enhancing the transfer of beneficial traits between species. By understanding the molecular mechanisms behind hybrid seed failure, breeders may be able to develop more resilient crops that can better withstand environmental stresses, improve yield, and maintain biodiversity.",

        "summary": "(Toronto, November 11, 2024) A new study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research by JMIR Publications reveals promising results from a digital health intervention that is based on a decade of research at Harvard Medical School and designed to alleviate depressive symptoms. The study, titled \"Facilitating Thought Progression to Reduce Depressive Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial,\" found that participants experienced substantial reduction of depressive symptoms by using a gamified mobile app focused on disrupting ruminative thinking.\nLed by Prof. Moshe Bar and colleagues, the research focused on a new gamified approach to target ruminative thinking\u2014a major contributor to depression. The app used in this study includes 5 mini-games designed to help users break negative thought cycles, encouraging flexible thought progression.\nOver the 8-week randomized controlled trial, conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital, participants using the app showed faster and more substantial symptom improvement than those not using the app, based on weekly clinician evaluations throughout the study. Additionally, the positive effects of using the app were still evident up to 4 weeks after the study ended, indicating the potential long-lasting impact of the app.\n\"After demonstrating in the laboratory the striking effect of facilitating thought progression on mood, we now reveal that implementing this neuroscience-based approach in a digital app can provide a most viable path for the alleviation of depression symptoms,\" reported Prof. Moshe Bar.\nThis study shows that a gamified app can offer a unique and potent way to break negative thought cycles by facilitating the progression of thought. By implementing effective therapy that is both engaging and accessible, this science-based gamified approach can complement traditional treatment methods for depression.\nOriginal article:\nYatziv S, Pedrelli P, Baror S, DeCaro S, Shachar N, Sofer B, Hull S, Curtiss J, Bar M.

        "summary": "The dual goals of climate action and ending violence against children can be achieved according to a new paper by Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. For the first time, governments are committing funds and making concrete pledges to reach the UN Sustainable Development Goal target of ending violence against children. On November 7th and 8th, the Government of Colombia, with support of the Government of Sweden, UNICEF, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence Against Children, and the World Health Organization will attend the first Global Ministerial Conference on ending violence against children.\nThe researchers outline how climate policy can be integrated into violence prevention and response which until now have not been linked as a framework for reaching the UN sustainable development targets for 2030. The findings are published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.\n\"2024 marks a watershed moment in violence prevention. This convening has the potential to accelerate proven solutions towards ending all forms of violence against children (VAC) by 2030. However, achieving the goal will require synergies with the climate agenda,\" says Ilan Cerna-Turoff, PhD, in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School.\nThe authors make the point that rising temperatures and intensifying extreme weather can increase the risk of violence by collapsing state and interpersonal protection systems; changing socio-behavioral norms; increasing stress and negative coping; and exacerbating mental health conditions. Regions that are highly sensitive to climate change also have the highest prevalence of violence and largest percentage of children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\nDr. Cerna-Turoff outlines several proposals on how each national pledge to end violence might be extended to be climate-sensitive, in-line with the global frameworks, including: Building policies and enforcement structures to respond to violence during climate migration and displacement and during and after extreme weather; Integrating gender and age in the structuring of emergency facilities and housing; Increasing community safety by addressing violence hotspots during reconstruction efforts and climate-resilient infrastructure projects (eg., areas without street lighting and street traffic); Producing regional, national, and sub-national plans for equal service provision and reporting of violence during and after climate migration and displacement and extreme weather; Engaging parents and caregivers in emergency facilities and housing on parenting practices;\nProviding economic support for communities that experience economic loss and integrating gender-sensitive training into programming to support the equal education and protection of girls; Ensuring a climate lens is integrated into mental health, addiction treatment, job training, and other social services offered to adolescents; Considering mass/social media and education campaigns to change norms and reduce violence in communities receiving climate migrants and those displaced by climate change; and Providing alternative violence reporting structures during school closures and in areas without school access during and after extreme weather and climate migration and displacement.\n\"Integrating climate and violence policy is a wise investment,\" says Cerna-Turoff. \"Climate change will be costly for health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries which are most affected and have competing priorities for limited resources.\"\nFor example, if warming remains below 20OC, climate mitigation investment will need to increase by at least six-fold in Southeast Asia and developing nations in the Pacific, five-fold in Africa, and fourteen-fold in the Middle East by 2030. Developing nations globally will require at least US$127 billion per year to finance climate adaptation. These sums are exponentially higher than current spending.\nHe continues, \"This is also an issue of structural violence. While high income countries are driving the rise in temperatures, people in low- and middle-income countries are more affected. We can promote a society where all groups can benefit from better health and development, and no one is left behind.\"\nCo-author is Professor Karen Devries of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nThe study was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, grant K99ES035895.\nColumbia University Mailman School of Public Health",

        "summary": "New research from the University of Nottingham has highlighted how Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) systems could be made more efficient at converting solar power into usable energy if they used wavy pipes instead of conventional straight pipes.\nPVT systems are 'hybrid' systems that combine photovoltaic (PV) technology that directly converts sunlight into electricity (solar panels), with thermal components to convert the leftover sun's energy into heat.\nThis dual functionality allows PVT systems to improve overall energy efficiency by converting sunlight into both electrical and thermal energy, making them more efficient (more than 70 per cent) than standalone PV systems (15 per cent).\nAnother benefit of PVT systems is that the solar panel temperature stays low, thereby maintaining higher efficiencies.\nThe research team, led by Dr Surojit Sen from the Faculty of Engineering, used a computer model to study how the PVT system, that uses wavy pipes, works. The proposed system is able to utilise the sun much more effectively and also keeps the solar panels at optimum temperature, resulting in higher electricity generation.\nThe research, published in Applied Thermal Engineering, explained that the PVT system using wavy pipes was able to capture more than 85 per cent of the thermal energy they received.\nIn comparison, conventional PVT systems with straight tubes of equivalent size are only 72 per cent efficient.\nThey tested how different parts of the system, like the shape of the pipes, the speed of the fluid inside, and the size of the panels, affected how well the system worked and how much energy was generated.\nAs global energy demand continues to grow, and environmental concerns surrounding fossil fuels also grow, the efficiency of solar power and other renewable sources has increasing importance.\nAdjusting other parts of the system, like the size of the pipes, the speed of the fluid in them, and the size of the collector, increased the efficiency of the solar panels even further.\nThe width of the panel was also found to be an important factor in how much energy is wasted with solar panels, with a wider panel causing more wasted energy. Humans spend about 15 per cent of all energy usage, about 600 billion gigajoules, on indoor heating only. It is crucial to rapidly move over to cleaner energy sources and what better than the sun.\nHe added: \"This study focusses on novel geometries of fluid channels in solar heating systems that holds the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of converting freely available solar energy into indoor heating and electricity.\"",

We know that traffickers deliberately target and exploit those with increased vulnerabilities, and there is perhaps no more vulnerable population than minorities - whether defined by ethnicity, race, religion, or legal status.\"\nSami Ryhaenen, Head of the Strategic Police Matters Unit, highlighted that \"human rights-based police responses can play a pivotal role in ensuring that victims of trafficking belonging to minorities are able to access protection and justice on an equal basis with others. Fostering dialogue among institutions and strengthening police-public partnerships have a crucial role to play in building stronger bonds with communities and preventing crime.\"\nIn his opening remarks, Ambassador Marek Szczygiel, Director and Officer-in-Charge of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities emphasized that \"given the multifaced dimension of human trafficking, a cross-institutional approach is essential to effectively address the many different layers of this serious crime.\"\nPeter Mossop, Special Adviser and Director's Representative in Vienna of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, added that \"discrimination or negative experiences with law enforcement, secondary victimization, fear of reprisals, and lack of information about legal rights may result in reduced reporting of crimes, making victims belonging to minorities less visible in the systems meant to protect them.\"\nThe event drew on the findings of the recent report Addressing the Dynamics of Trafficking in Persons Belonging to Minorities, Including National Minorities , published by the Office of Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, as well as the OSCE guide on Good Practices in Building Police-Public Partnerships , published by the Strategic Police Matters Unit.",

        "excerpt": "A sewage pumping station failure killed over 2,000 fish in Melksham, with sewage from a burst rising main also killing fish near Weston-super-Mare",
        "summary": "Wessex Water has been found negligent after sewage leaks killed thousands of fish - with the company failing to report incidents to the Environment Agency as early as it should have.\nSwindon Magistrates' Court today sentenced the company to pay a total fine of \u00a3500,000 after it pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two charges relating to the Bowerhill Lodge sewage pumping station at Melksham, Wiltshire, and one relating to a burst sewer main at the Wick St Lawrence sewage treatment works near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset.\nThe company was also ordered to pay costs of \u00a360,000, plus applicable VAT, and a victim surcharge of \u00a3170.\nThe charges\nThe two charges at Bowerhill Lodge were of causing storm water to discharge into the Clackers Brook between late March and early April 2018 and discharging screened sewage in late July to early August 2018.\nThe third charge was of causing untreated sewage effluent to discharge into marsh rhynes (a type of manmade drainage channel) from a rising main leading into the Wick St Lawrence works.\nNearly every fish within a kilometre killed in Clackers Brook incident\nIn a case brought by the Environment Agency, the court heard that more than 2,100 fish died in the Clackers Brook, a tributary of the River Avon, during the discharge at Bowerhill Lodge. These included eels, lamprey and bullheads - three species which are threatened, and are also listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nAlmost all of the fish within a 1km reach had been killed. The discharge was caused by a mechanical failure and continued for 54.5 hours with sewage flowing through a nature conservation area. The company did not report this to the Environment Agency immediately.\nThe investigation found that failures of the sewage pumping station's alarm and telemetry system, and a power cable becoming entangled in pump equipment, contributed to the failures. Further investigation found that there had been other discharges from Bowerhill Lodge Pumping Station earlier that year that Wessex Water had not reported to the Environment Agency.\nFish killed at Wick St Lawrence despite critical pipe being flagged for monitoring\nAt Wick St Lawrence, much of the local rhyne was affected with sewage, leading to fish, including spined stickleback and eels, dying after a rising main (a pipe through which sewage is pumped under pressure) burst.\nThe rising main had already been identified by Wessex Water, prior to the incident, as a critical rising main that needed to be monitored. However, monitoring was not put in place until after the incident.\nAgeing pipes more vulnerable to bursting\nThe investigation found that a September 2018 document the company submitted to Ofwat showed the number of rising main bursts had increased markedly in recent years, running at approximately 70-80 per year. The company's rising mains are ageing and becoming vulnerable to bursting. The company predicted it would need to replace them at nine times its current rate to remain stable.\nBetween 2015 and 2023, Wessex Water had caused 28 serious pollution incidents, 6 of which have arisen from rising mains - accounting for 21% of serious incidents during that period.\nNot reporting failures 'undermines the regulatory regime'\nDistrict Judge Joanna Dickens said that the company's failure to report discharges at Bowerhill Lodge \"undermines the regulatory regime\" though Wessex Water had since taken \"considerable and expensive steps\" to remedy the situation.\nShe noted that at Wick St Lawrence flow pressure monitoring equipment had been installed since the incident and there had been no repetition of any similar incidents. The Judge said that while there was no long-lasting impact to the environment in this case \"it was negligent because of the failures at this specific location and the failure to install monitoring equipment at an earlier time\".\n'Monitoring is reliant on failure - replace rising mains before they fail'\nJanine Maclean, Environment Agency senior environment officer, said:\nThese cases are further examples of a water company breaking the law and causing serious pollution. It was very sad the pollutions had such serious impacts - killing fish and other aquatic life.\nWessex Water's rising mains are ageing and becoming vulnerable to bursting and are an area of increasing concern to the Environment Agency, presenting risk to people and the environment.\nWe recognise the company is increasing its monitoring of rising mains, which is a positive step forward, but monitoring is still reliant on failure, and we would like to see the company significantly increase the level of investment it makes to proactively replace rising mains before they fail.\nWe expect all water companies to manage and maintain their sewage pumping stations and rising mains in a responsible and sustainable manner to ensure they do not cause pollution. We hope these cases send a clear signal to shareholders and water company board rooms, up and down the country, that investing in resilient sewage systems to prevent pollution, and ensure compliance, must be an essential way of doing business.\nOur dedicated officers are increasing our regulatory inspections of Wessex Water's sewage pumping stations and we will also be attending more incidents, including those arising from rising mains, with the new resources we are gaining to transform the way we regulate the water industry.\nBackground\nCharges:\nMelksham , Wilts\nBetween the 27th day of March 2018 and the 3rd day of April 2018 at Bowerhill Lodge Sewage Pumping Station, otherwise than in accordance with an environmental permit, caused a water discharge activity, namely discharges of storm water into Clackers Brook. Contrary to Regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.\nBetween the 29th day of July 2018 and the 2nd day of August 2018 at Bowerhill Lodge Sewage Pumping Station you contravened condition 1 of Environmental Permit number 012661 in that a discharge of screened sewage was made as a result of the pumping station becoming inoperative due to mechanical and electrical breakdown when said breakdown could have been prevented. Contrary to Regulation 38(2) Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2016.\nWick, Somerset\nOn or before the 20th day of August 2018 on land adjacent to Wick St Lawrence Sewage Treatment Works, otherwise than in accordance with an environmental permit, caused a water discharge activity, namely the discharge of untreated sewage effluent into the marsh rhyne system. Contrary to Regulations 12(1)(b) and 38(1)(a) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.\nGlossary:\nA rising main carries sewage under pressure from a pumping station to a discharge point, for example a gravity sewer or a sewage treatment works.\nA rhyne is a regional term used to describe a type of manmade drainage channel.\nThe crackdown on water companies to improve water quality has seen nearly 500 inspections carried out by Environment Agency officers in the South West since April.",

The first Armistice Day honouring those who served and made the ultimate sacrifice in the First World War was held the following year, and renamed Remembrance Day in 1931. Canadians now observe two minutes of silence at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month as a sign of respect for all those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving across our country's history. We also remember the physical, mental and moral scars left on those who fought to defend democracy and freedom in conflicts from Canada's earliest days to the present. We honour their contributions that helped build the country we love today.\n\"We also recognize the sacrifices of those behind the lines; the families who never again saw their spouses, sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers. They too remain forever in our hearts as we honour those who have worn the uniform proudly.\n\"We remember those who signed up to serve, no matter the cost: from the First and Second World Wars, to the Korean War, to modern operations in the Persian Gulf or peacekeeping missions in the Congo. Canadian service women and men have kept us safe here at home and abroad. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian law enforcement have served honourably and bravely. As Canadians, we have a duty to commemorate their contributions.\n\"This year, Canada marks several significant military anniversaries, such as the centennial of the Royal Canadian Air Force; the 80th anniversaries of D-Day and the battle of Normandy; the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Scheldt; the 60th anniversary of the beginning of Canada's peacekeeping efforts in Cyprus; the 50th anniversary of the loss of nine Canadian Armed Forces peacekeepers in Syria; and the 10th anniversary of the end of Canada's mission in Afghanistan.\n\"Over the past few days - during Veterans' Week - Canadians have gathered at memorials, cenotaphs and cemeteries in communities from coast to coast to coast to pay their respects to the courage of those who have served in uniform. These events reflect the gratitude of Canadians for the security we enjoy today. Together, we will preserve the memory of those who served, and what they gave, so we could be free.\n\"This Remembrance Day, we take time to honour the fallen, Canada's Veterans and currently serving military and police members for their courage, service and sacrifice, at home and around the world, as well as their families and their loved ones.\n\"Lest we forget.\"",

        "summary": "Vaccine experts drew attention to disruption factors around vaccine development and key action plans for future pandemic preparedness planning.\nImperial College London hosted the Natural Sciences Research Showcase on 26 September that spotlighted cutting-edge research by the Faculty of Natural Science's early-career scientists. Bringing the event to a close was a panel discussion on vaccine development and deployment hosted by four experts across the Faculty of Medicine, Department of Chemistry and Business School.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts and scientists have propelled vaccine research.\nThe panel featured four experts in the field of vaccine development and deployment: Dr Nazila Kamaly (Department of Chemistry), Professor Marisa Miraldo (Centre for Health Economics & Policy Innovation), Dr Katy Gaythorpe (School of Public Health) and Dr Stephanie Ascough (Department of infectious Disease), chaired by Professor Erhard Hohenester (Department of Life Sciences).\nThe researchers shared a few key scientific, economic and social challenges behind pandemic preparedness and lessons learned from the COVID-19 epidemic. Global collaboration is key\nDr Kamaly started the discussion by focusing on the importance of collaboration between scientific disciplines. She said: \"To meet the challenges of pandemics, we need greater collaboration on a global level between chemists, biologists, engineers and immunologists.\"\nA prime example of this is a current project led by Imperial, which will be co-funded by US $57m (\u00a344m) from the European Union's Horizon Europe Programme and CEPI (the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations). Dr Ascot outlined these institutions. She added: \"These institutional bodies prepare by working across cross cultural and global boundaries. We can't keep reacting, it's how we prepare.\"\nFactors, from research and development to educational and training bodies are key to pandemic preparedness, instead of relying on vaccine development alone.\nVaccine coverage varies, and recently there has been a drop in the coverage of COVID vaccines. Experts pointed out that different vaccines may offer better efficacy or lower side effects in some demographics than others. The COVID epidemic revealed global inequalities in vaccine access and equity, with some countries being unable to rollout a range of vaccines.\nProfessor Miraldo pointed out that, \"There is a divide between high- and low-income countries and there is no international jurisdiction to ensure low-income countries can access vaccine variety.\"\nIn offering different vaccine options for the same virus, it would close financial gaps in global healthcare. Pre-empt pandemic disruption\nPandemic disruption factors included vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Both greatly affect coverage of vaccine rollouts. Dr Gaythorpe said: \"Challenges involve building trust between healthcare providers and local communities. Dr Katy Gaythorpe School of Public Health\n\"Many members of the public questioned how quickly the COVID-19 vaccines were deployed which created a lot of controversy.\"\n\"It takes years to develop a vaccine that blocks transmission. Vaccine development often starts off as an immunology vaccine which boosts the person's immunity. It's likely they will still get the virus, but it won't be as severe. Best case scenario, that they won't need hospitalising.\"\nDecades of research underpinning mRNA vaccines was carried out before the pandemic hit but had never been developed blocking transmission phases.\nShe and other panelists emphasised that researchers needed to be better at communicating the differences in immunity-boosting versus transmission-blocking vaccines to better build public understanding. Dr Ascough said: \"We've been bad at communicating this to the public. They get confused because they still got the virus despite having the vaccine \u2013 and bad communication is how misinformation gets spread.\"\nThe panel iterated that vaccination is so complex because of disruption that spans across not only scientific barriers, but social and economic ones too. They concluded that preparedness and collaboration are central to future pandemic planning.\nThis involves increasing capital for lower-income countries and channeling efforts towards education, ensuring that they have the means to collaborate fully with experts across the globe.",

The researchers then surveyed 800 park users.\nTo hear one of the installations\nThe results indicate that the experience of park users was enhanced in the presence of all 4 sound installations, which resulted in calmer and more pleasant soundscapes. Respondents also reported a decrease in how loud the other urban sounds felt.\nThe study revealed that the sound installations had a particularly strong, positive effect when there was construction noise. The team also learned that while sound installations can distract attention from negative sounds, such as traffic and air conditioning, they were also found to distract from positive sounds, such as birds and voices. The team also pointed out that the study was conducted in a well-planned area, with a pre-existing sound environment that was already quite pleasant: it is unlikely that sound installations alone would suffice to tackle all noise problems in more exposed areas.\n\"We want people to think of sound not just as pollution, but as a resource to enjoy in the city,\" said Val\u00e9rian Fraisse, a PhD student at the Schulich School of Music and corresponding author on the study, which was recently published in Landscape and Urban Planning.\nThe research group is also working on raising awareness of the importance of integrating sound into urban planning, Fraisse said.\nFind more information about other Sounds in the City projects in Montreal.\nThe study: \"Shaping city soundscapes: In situ comparison of four sound installations in an urban public space\" by V.

        "summary": "Last Friday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen participated in an informal meeting of the European Council in Budapest.\nAt the summit, EU Leaders adopted the Budapest Declaration , which lays out a new European Competitiveness Deal to address the current geopolitical, economic, and demographic challenges and ensure Europe's continued prosperity.\nThe basis for the discussion was the recent report prepared by professor Mario Draghi, who also took part in the summit and presented his findings to the Leaders.\nIn her statement to the press after the summit, President von der Leyen particularly highlighted the need for innovation, investment, and strategic security.\nShe highlighted the urgent need to reduce the regulatory barriers to innovation by cutting red tape. She presented her idea to propose a common 28th regulatory regime with a single rule book for innovative start-ups in the whole European Union.\n\"We have around 182,000 innovative SMEs: So this will give them access to the whole Single Market and give them the possibility to scale up. The goal is indeed to use the full Single Market to scale up,\" the President said.\nFurthermore, she signalled to move forward the work on a European Savings and Investments Union, to mobilise private capital investments in European innovation.\nThe President also spoke of the need to have a joint plan for competitiveness, decarbonisation and digitalisation, which the new Commission will address in its first 100 days with the Clean Industrial Deal. Likewise, Leaders spoke of the importance to reinforce the EU's strategic security, and secure supply chains, especially when it comes to critical raw materials.\nEU Leaders also took stock of the result of the elections in the United States. President von der Leyen said: \"The United States is our biggest economic and trading partner. We share a unique historical bond. And our citizens share millions of friendships across the Atlantic. So it is important to build good relations with the new administration from the very beginning. This is how we will continue to shape a positive transatlantic agenda.\"\nShe also mentioned that she spoke by phone to President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him and discussed several topics including Ukraine, defence, trade, and energy.\nFinally, President von der Leyen used the opportunity to thank outgoing European Council President Charles Michel, saying that: \"today we are stronger than we were five years ago, and this is also your success.\"\nEuropean Political Community meets again to strengthen the extended European family\nOn Thursday, President von der Leyen also participated in the 5th meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), which brought together over 40 European Heads of State and Government from EU Member States as well as 18 other European states.\nThe summit focused on the continent's security challenges, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, the US elections, migration, economic security, and connectivity.\nIn the sidelines of the EPC, the President, together with other leaders met with Moldova's President Maia Sandu. In a statement following the meeting, they congratulated President Sandu for her victory in Moldova's presidential elections and welcomed the positive vote on enshrining EU accession in Moldova's Constitution.\nPresident von der Leyen also used the occasion to hold bilateral meetings with the President of the Swiss Federation Viola Amherd, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as T\u00fcrkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, underlining the EPC's value as a venue for leaders to meet and exchange views on common challenges and opportunities.",

The next of kin of over 30 former firefighters, police officers and other public servants who have died in public service will receive the award in recognition of their deceased loved ones.\nThe Emblem was announced earlier this year to commemorate public servants who died in the line of duty. The Emblem is the civilian equivalent of the Elizabeth Cross, which recognises members of the UK Armed Forces who died in action or as a result of a terrorist attack.\nAmong the first recipients is Sally Taylor, the widow of PC George Taylor, who was killed while on patrol on November 30, 1976. He was attacked by two men dressed in prison uniform who had escaped from The State Hospital at Carstairs in Lanarkshire. Also receiving the emblem is Archibald MacLellan, son of Neil MacLellan, a Nursing Officer on duty at the State Hospital that night. He was also killed, along with a patient, by the two men who escaped.\nAlso honoured is Firefighter William Crocket who will be awarded the Emblem over 60 years after he died in an explosion at the Cheapside Street Whisky Bond in Glasgow that claimed the lives of 19 people on 28 March 1960. Firefighter Crocket's son William Cruickshank will receive the Emblem on behalf of his late father.\nThe Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer said:\n\"We must never forget those who have given their lives to protect others in the line of duty.\n\"While families will never be able to replace their loved ones, the Elizabeth Emblem pays tribute to the sacrifice they have made.\"\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland, Ian Murray said:\n\"The Elizabeth Emblem is inscribed with the words 'For A Life Given In Service' - and nothing could be more apt. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the seven Scottish public servants who receive this new honour today.\n\"I want to personally thank the families of the police officers, firefighters and NHS nurses who are recognised today for their bravery and service. Your loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the wider community and for that we will be forever grateful.\"\nThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden said:\n\"We owe a debt of gratitude to our exceptional public servants who have given their lives in service of our nation.\n\"The Elizabeth Emblem will honour their dedication and I am pleased to see the first recipients named today.\"\nTo mark the announcement of the first recipients of the Elizabeth Emblem, the first batch of Emblems will be awarded by His Majesty The King later this year. The design of the Emblem incorporates a rosemary wreath, a traditional symbol of remembrance, which surrounds the Tudor Crown. It is inscribed with 'For A Life Given In Service', and will have the name of the person for whom it is in memoriam inscribed on the reverse of the Emblem. It will include a pin to allow the award to be worn on clothing by the next of kin of the deceased.\nFamilies and next of kin of those who have died in public service are encouraged to apply for an Elizabeth Emblem.",

        "summary": "Waltham \u2014 November 11, 2024 \u2014 Two measures of patient well-being, designed for use in busy clinical settings, are described in a Perspective piece in a supplement to Medical Care , the official journal of the Medical Care Section of the American Public Health Association . The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer . The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer .\nThe Medical Care piece describes perspectives and research surrounding well-being and whole person outcomes and measurement, which was the focus of a recent VA State of the Art (SOTA) conference on this topic. The conference was part of the ongoing effort in VA to move towards a \"Whole Health\" approach which focuses on what matters most to the veteran.\n\"In recent years there has been a growing call for healthcare providers to expand their primary focus beyond treating disease to addressing the needs of the 'whole person',\" the developers of the tools note. \"Yet healthcare providers have received little guidance regarding which well-being measures are best suited to the clinical context or how these measures may be best applied to enhance clinical practice.\"\nIn response to this problem, Dawne S. Vogt, PhD, a research scientist at the National Center for PTSD within the VA Boston Healthcare System and a professor of psychiatry at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, and colleagues in the Veterans Health Administration created two assessment tools: Well-Being Signs (WBS) and Well-Being Brief (WBB).\nWell-Being Signs can guide treatment planning\nThe WBS can be self-administered or administered by a clinician in less than one minute. On scales of 0 to 10, the patient indicates how often they have participated in the roles and activities that are most important to them, functioned their best in those endeavors, and were fully satisfied with how things are going in those aspects of their lives.\nInformation from the WBS can prompt discussion between a patient and a healthcare professional about how treatment plans may be designed and/or modified to best optimize the patient's well-being and whether additional support may be needed to address areas of lower well-being. Psychometric testing is complete and the WBS is now available to the field.\nThe Well-Being Brief is more in-depth but still efficient\nThe WBB is a self-administered measure that can be completed in about six minutes and is used to evaluate four areas in which the patient may benefit from support that extends beyond medical care: Vocation\u2014How well an individual is doing in their vocational pursuits, including their involvement, functioning, and satisfaction with regard to paid work, education and training experiences, and caregiving activities. Financial\u2014How well an individual is doing with regard to their financial circumstances, including their ability to meet basic needs for food and shelter, transportation, and legal needs and their ability to prepare for their financial future. Health\u2014The extent to which individuals are experiencing good health states, are engaging in health-promoting behaviors, and perceive that their health and health care access allows them to live their lives as they wish. Social\u2014The extent to which individuals have social ties, function well in their social interactions, and are satisfied with their relationships with intimate partners, friends, and family and their broader community.\nThe WBB was designed to inform referrals to professionals and programs that support well-being. For example, it can identify patients who would benefit from career counseling, financial-management support, or counseling to improve their social relationships.\nDr. Vogt and her colleagues say that although they have only just begun to explore how well-being measurements can be used in clinical care, \"we are optimistic that attending to the well-being of the 'whole person' can better meet patients' needs and improve healthcare outcomes.\"",

        "summary": "Washington, D.C.\u2014Delaware has numerous inland waterways with high microbial impairment from unknown sources. Now, a new study suggests that human waste, both treated and untreated, is responsible for the waterway impairment in these Delaware watersheds. The study was published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology , a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.\nAccording to the Clean Water Act, when water is contaminated by pollutants and doesn't meet the standards of clean water, the water bodies are considered impaired. In the new study, researchers worked with the state water quality monitoring staff to collect water across many different locations from 3 different inland watersheds in the southern part of Delaware. They were able to see the microbial communities present in the water by examining the DNA in the water. \"The nice thing about this study is that the sampling happened on a monthly basis across 2 different years, 2020 and 2021. We were able to capture a lot of different seasonal, tidal and geographic location differences to look at this in a very comprehensive manner,\" said study coauthor Jennifer Biddle, Ph.D., a professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware.\nThe researchers compared the DNA signatures in the water to DNA signatures from a library that contained signatures from many different organisms that live across Delaware, including domestic and livestock as well as human signatures. The researchers found that the majority of the microbial signatures in the water were comparable to a human waste signature and did not match an animal signature, either domestic or agricultural.\n\"This idea that you live downstream from a cow farm and thus your water is impaired\u2026 we never found that being any sort of signature in the water. It was a majority human signature,\" Biddle said. The study suggests that the way the microbes are present in the environment are most similar to what is seen from human waste, treated waste and untreated human waste. \"With a library of over 10,000 signatures from different microbes, we were able to say that this looks like a human signature instead of a goose signature or some other animal. We don't have a massive issue with animal inputs in the waterway,\" Biddle added. \"People might have concerns about migratory geese or agricultural animals, but it seems like that waste isn't a concern.\"\nThe study indicates that infrastructure type problems may be the cause of water impairment. \"We saw a septic system signature in the water,\" Biddle said. \"We need to look into infrastructure issues and systems that might have been installed a long time ago.\" Currently, septic systems in Delaware don't need to be replaced until a property is sold, but the study suggests that property owners should more frequently make sure their septic systems are up to code.\n\"Our ability right now to look at the microbiology of an environment with a massive sequencing approach is very useful and has increased in its utility, beyond just examining what the EPA regulations regularly require,\" Biddle said.",

        "summary": "New research in Social Psychological and Personality Science identifies a widespread stereotype linking wealth to perceived trustworthiness across diverse cultures. The research, led by M\u00e9lusine Boon-Falleur from the Center for Research on Social Inequalities at Sciences Po in Paris, shows that individuals with fewer material resources are consistently viewed as less trustworthy.\nThe study, conducted across eight countries including Brazil, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, France, Nigeria, Philippines, and the United Kingdom, employed a novel method to uncover stereotypes while avoiding social desirability bias.\n\"People with fewer resources are consistently perceived to be less trustworthy by people around the world, even among individuals who have few resources themselves,\" states Dr. Boon-Falleur, summarizing the study's most significant finding.\nThis research contributes to the broader academic discussion by highlighting the importance of socioeconomic background in shaping stereotypes, alongside well-known demographic attributes such as gender, age, or race. It also emphasizes the need to consider both the characteristics of the person \"doing the trusting\" and the person being trusted when examining trust dynamics.\nThe implications of these findings are far-reaching. \"By becoming aware of this stereotype, people may try to overcome this bias, or put in place programs in their organization to counteract this,\" Dr. Boon-Falleur explains. She adds, \"For people with low SES backgrounds, realizing that they may be perceived as less trustworthy could explain certain attitudes or behaviors towards them.\"\nIn the context of current world events, the research suggests that deepening social inequalities in Western countries could lead to decreased social trust as poverty rates increase. It may also shed light on patterns of discrimination against certain migrant groups.\nDr. Boon-Falleur cautions against misinterpretation: \"The main misrepresentation of these results would be to say that individuals with fewer resources are in fact less trustworthy rather than individuals with fewer resources are perceived to be less trustworthy. To date, there is no scientific evidence systematically showing that individuals with fewer resources are less trustworthy.\"\nOne of the most striking aspects of the study is the universality of these stereotypes. \"Often, we tend to think that highly capitalist countries or only Western countries have negative stereotypes towards certain groups,\" Dr. Boon-Falleur notes. \"However, what we found in our study was that in all countries surveyed, including in places such as Goma (Democratic Republic of Congo), such stereotypes also exist.\"\nFuture research will explore the malleability of these stereotypes and their potential behavioral implications. The study's findings open new avenues for understanding and addressing socioeconomic biases in interpersonal trust on a global scale.",

        "excerpt": "Heat stroke is primarily classified into exertional and non-exertional forms. Exertional heat stroke results from strenuous physical activity in high",
        "summary": "Heat stroke is primarily classified into exertional and non-exertional forms. Exertional heat stroke results from strenuous physical activity in high heat, while non-exertional heat stroke typically affects those exposed to extreme heat without engaging in significant physical exertion. Symptoms include elevated body temperature, impaired consciousness, headaches, muscle spasms, and, in severe cases, cardiovascular overload, cerebral hypoxia, and organ failure. Western medicine's primary treatments include cooling methods, rehydration, and pharmacological interventions like dexamethasone and diazepam to address cerebral edema and convulsions. However, these methods sometimes lead to side effects such as excessive sweating, nausea, and gastrointestinal issues.\nIn TCM, heat stroke falls under \"Yang summerheat syndrome,\" a condition associated with the pathogenic \"fire-heat\" energy that disrupts the body's natural balance. Bloodletting therapy, practiced for centuries in TCM, involves releasing small amounts of blood from specific acupoints to alleviate heat, improve circulation, and release pathogenic factors trapped within the body. This review evaluates bloodletting techniques and their efficacy in treating heat stroke, offering insights for modern clinical application.\nBloodletting by Acupuncture at EX-UE11\nEX-UE11, known as one of the extra points in acupuncture, is located at the fingertips and is pivotal in TCM for harmonizing the body's Yin and Yang energies. Bloodletting at this point is performed by piercing the fingertips with a three-edged needle to release two or three drops of blood, which is thought to alleviate excess internal heat. This technique improves circulation, promotes heat dissipation, and, from a Western perspective, stimulates pain receptors that can activate the body's central thermoregulation system. By enhancing blood flow and reducing inflammation, this method facilitates the body's natural cooling process and aids in preventing heat-related organ dysfunction.\nEar-Tip Puncture and Bloodletting Therapy\nThe ear-tip point, located at the apex of the ear, is significant in TCM for \"purging fire,\" especially for conditions where heat ascends to the head, leading to symptoms like high fever and fainting. Ear-tip puncture involves pricking the ear's tip to release blood, which starts as darkened and purplish, a TCM indication of trapped heat. The therapy not only directly removes heat but also clears the meridians, promotes detoxification, and helps restore consciousness in patients suffering from severe heat stroke symptoms. Studies highlight that ear-tip bloodletting can stimulate nerve endings, which may help reduce hyperthermic effects and alleviate convulsions, making it an effective emergency response method with minimal discomfort.\nWell Point Puncture and Bloodletting Therapy\nThe well points, located at the extremities of fingers and toes, are Shu acupoints essential in TCM for managing febrile conditions. Bloodletting therapy at well points is thought to promote microcirculation and peripheral blood flow, effectively redirecting the body's heat outward and enhancing the brain's oxygen supply, which is vital for preventing heat-induced ischemic damage. The well points at the fingertips, in particular, allow for targeted intervention to cool the body and relieve symptoms like dizziness, high fever, and mental disorientation. Clinical reports suggest that well-point puncture can provide both rapid relief and sustained temperature control, emphasizing its utility in emergency settings.\nCupping and Bloodletting at GV14\nGV14, situated at the back of the neck, is an intersection of Yang meridians and a key acupoint for managing excess heat in the upper body. Cupping combined with bloodletting at this point is an ancient TCM practice, believed to release pathogenic factors by creating an outlet for trapped heat. The procedure involves piercing the GV14 point with a three-edged needle, followed by fire cupping, which uses heat and suction to draw out stagnant blood. The cupping procedure improves blood circulation, reduces inflammation, and accelerates metabolic waste removal. Reports on this therapy show that it is highly effective in cooling the body, with a clinical efficacy rate reaching 98% for reducing fever. However, it requires further research to confirm its underlying mechanisms and long-term safety.\nPrecautions and Contraindications\nBloodletting therapy, while beneficial for excess-heat conditions, has specific contraindications. Patients with significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, or coagulation disorders, those with severe skin infections, and vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly should generally avoid bloodletting. It is also crucial to prevent infection through stringent sterilization and to use disposable equipment. Practitioners must monitor for potential adverse effects, such as excessive bleeding or dizziness, and avoid repeated punctures at the same location to reduce tissue damage and inflammation.\nFuture Directions\nAlthough bloodletting has shown efficacy in managing heat stroke, modern studies exploring its mechanisms are limited. Research should focus on understanding how bloodletting influences systemic and peripheral microcirculation, nerve regulation, and immune responses. Additionally, randomized controlled trials and clinical studies could help standardize bloodletting techniques and safety protocols. Such research would bridge TCM practices with evidence-based medicine, offering a broader therapeutic scope for heat stroke management.\nConclusions\nBloodletting therapy, an ancient TCM practice, holds potential as an effective, accessible, and minimally invasive treatment for heat stroke. By regulating body heat, improving microcirculation, and promoting detoxification, it provides a complementary approach to conventional treatments. Despite the promising outcomes observed in TCM settings, rigorous scientific investigations are necessary to establish clear clinical guidelines and optimize bloodletting for heat stroke treatment. Integrating this therapy within modern healthcare could improve outcomes for patients in regions where heat stroke is a growing concern, offering an alternative solution rooted in traditional wisdom.\nFull text:\nhttps://www.xiahepublishing.com/2835-6357/FIM-2023-00088S\nThe study was recently published in the Future Integrative Medicine .\nFuture Integrative Medicine (FIM) publishes both basic and clinical research, including but not limited to randomized controlled trials, intervention studies, cohort studies, observational studies, qualitative and mixed method studies, animal studies, and systematic reviews.",

Picture:.\n'Real facts': Why Taylor Swift really gave future Olympic city a miss\nMr Politis already has a substantial footprint in South East Queensland via his shareholding in SEQ Hospitality Group which is part of the Fortitudo Group that owns and runs several venues like the QA Hotel in New Farm and Treetops Tavern in Burleigh, three more hotels and 17 bottle shops.\nThe takeover deal of $1.55 a share has been backed by Eumundi's directors who hold 43.34 per cent of Eumundi's stock, the Australian Stock Exchange was told in a statement Monday.\nThe 100 per cent takeover price was a premium of around 23 per cent over the closing price of Eumundi shares on October 29 ($1.26) when SEQ first made moves towards the firm.\nShares have since risen. sitting at $1.62 at Monday's close.\nThe Ashmore Tavern is part of the SEQ-Eumundi takeover deal.\nCost of land rises by as much as $120,000 in a year\nEumundi non executive chairman, Brisbane corporate lawyer Joe Gamin, who has interest in 13,021,572 shares (or 26.16 per cent) would stand to make $20.18m off the deal, while fellow director Gilbert De Luca \u2013 who has 8,548,118 Eumundi shares (or 17.18 per cent) \u2013 would pocket about $13.24m.\nThe takeover is subject to a 90 per cent minimum acceptance by Eumundi shareholders, and comes ahead of a general meeting at HopgoodGanim Lawyers office in Brisbane's Eagle Street on November 29 \u2013 though they are not expected to received documentation around the deal until the end of the year.\nThe Aspley Central Tavern is in a rapidly growing part of Brisbane's northside.\nMr Ganim said the SEQ transaction 'offers Eumundi shareholders an opportunity to realise their investments at a substantial premium to the current market price' \u2013 taken to mean the date of first approach.\n'The Board has carefully considered the SEQ Transaction in the context of other available alternatives as well as the continued uncertainty facing wider global markets,' he said.\n'We believe this transaction not only provides shareholders with an attractive exit, but also secures the continued success of Eumundi's current business operations.'\nThe Courthouse Hotel just south of the border would also form part of the deal.\nHe said SEQ was part of an established group which would mean a 'seamless transition' for the pubs and properties involved.\nEumundi has appointed Taylor Collison as its financial advisor and HopgoodGanim Lawyers as its legal advisor. SEQ has appointed Morgans as its financial advisor and Clayton Utz as its legal advisor.\nFOLLOW SOPHIE FOSTER",

        "summary": "Hari Nugroho explores the role of local dynamics in shaping Indonesian labour movements. By focusing on the micro-level, this research reveals how labour organisation strategies are influenced by individual actors' personal histories, their interactions, and the way in which they respond the local economic and political conditions. This approach fills a gap in labour studies by emphasizing the importance of social and cultural processes in understanding the diverse challenges leaders face within union movements, beyond institutional frameworks.\nNugroho's research Workplace and Community: Workers' politics of representation in Semarang and Pekalongan, Central Java' compares two types of workers' organisations: workplace unionism, which defends workers' interests through workplace-based activities; and community unionism, which advocates not only for workers but also for a broader range of people. He conducted his fieldwork in Pekalongan and Semarang, two industrial regions of Central Java, Indonesia. Nugroho explored the factors that drive workers to develop these different organisations and the impact this has on the relationships between union organisers and those they represent. Exploring Union Innovations\nNugroho: \"This study has been driven by the combination of personal experiences and the academic process. In the beginning, I was particularly impressed by the enthusiasm of several union organisers in Pekalongan, one of my research sites, who were striving to develop a form of unionism that was still quite uncommon in Indonesia at the time. When I proposed this as a topic for my PhD research at Leiden University, discussions with my supervisors led to a comparison with more traditional forms of unionism commonly found in Indonesia, such as the union in Semarang. This raised the question: Why did a few union-activists' experiment with innovative alternatives; and why did others continue to focus on traditional union models amidst the existing economic changes?\" Rise of alternative forms of workers' organisations\nAs his research progressed and Nugroho deepened his understanding of the topic, he found this comparison increasingly compelling and meaningful. \"I observed that the rise of alternative forms of workers' organisations has become more necessary, especially in light of recent changes in Indonesia's political landscape and the evolving nature of works.\" The importance of locality in understanding the development of labour movements\nNugroho's dissertation research highlights the importance of locality in understanding the development of labour movements. It is at the local level that labour organisers face their most complex challenges. In this context, they must navigate the interplay between the organisational strategies they adopt and the diverse realities of the people they represent-both union members and other community groups whose interests they are fighting for. Nugroho: \"This research is significant because it emphasises the role of individual actors, their subjectivity, their personal histories, and their interactions in the analysis of social movements--particularly labour movements.\" Understanding the role of individual actors and diversity in Indonesian Labour Movements\nThis analysis explores how individual actors connect with economic and political contexts across different times and places. It adds to Indonesian labour studies, which often focus on institutions but overlook the smaller social and cultural dynamics. These dynamics are key to understanding why labour movements can vary, even in similar regions and under the same national economic and political conditions, including global influences. Furthermore, this research helps labour organisation leaders, especially in Indonesia, to recognise the signficance of the diverse identities and political views of their members. These differences in diversity present complexities that are often challenging to manage, particularly when leaders are not fully aware of their intricate nature.\nBanner Photo by H.

        "summary": "WHO is pleased to announce the theme for the 2025 World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) campaign: \"Unmasking the Appeal: Exposing Industry Tactics on Tobacco and Nicotine Products.\" This year, the campaign will focus on revealing the tactics that the tobacco and nicotine industries use to make their harmful products seem attractive.\nWhy this theme?\nOne of the primary public health challenges today is the attractiveness of tobacco, nicotine, and related products, particularly to young audiences. The industry consistently tries to find ways to make these products appealing, adding flavours and other agents that change their smell, taste, or appearance. These additives are designed to mask the harshness of tobacco, thereby increasing its palatability, particularly among young people. Other tactics include: Glamorized marketing: Sleek designs, attractive colours, and alluring flavours are strategically used to attract a younger demographic, including through digital media channels.\nDeceptive designs: Some products mimic sweets, candies, and even cartoon characters\u2014items children naturally find appealing.\nCoolants and additives: These can make the experience smoother, increasing the likelihood of continued use and reducing the chance of quitting.\nThese tactics can contribute to early initiation of smoking or nicotine use, with potential lifelong addiction and health consequences. By making these products more attractive, the industry not only boosts their immediate consumer base but also makes quitting harder, prolonging exposure to harmful substances.\nGoals of the 2025 WNTD campaign\nOur 2025 WNTD campaign aims to: Raise awareness: Inform the public on how industry tactics manipulate the appearance and appeal of tobacco and nicotine products.\nAdvocate for policy change: measures to ban flavours and additives that make these products more appealing; complete bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, including on digital platforms; and regulation of the design of the products and their packages to make them less appealing.\nReduce demand:\nExposing these tactics aims to reduce demand, particularly among youth, ultimately lowering their exposure to nicotine and tobacco products.\nBy unmasking these strategies, the campaign will to shine a light on the ways the industry markets addiction, driving demand reduction efforts and supporting long-term public health.\nJoin the campaign to raise awareness and advocate for a healthier, tobacco-free future this World No Tobacco Day.",

        "summary": "American Heart Association\nResearch Highlights: A study of nearly 2,400 cardiac arrest cases in North Carolina found that when emergency dispatchers (telecommunicators) provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instructions to 911 callers, people were more likely to provide aid for both men and women.\nThe study's findings indicate that when a telecommunicator provided assistance to callers, bystander CPR was performed 44% of the time on women and 40% on men, compared to 9% on women and 11% on men when telecommunicator assistance was not provided.\nResearchers found the telecommunicator role critical in instructing bystanders to act quickly, possibly instrumental in reducing sex disparities in bystander CPR and deserving of further investigation.\nNote: The study featured in this news release is a research abstract. Abstracts presented at American Heart Association's scientific meetings are not peer-reviewed, and the findings are considered preliminary until published as full manuscripts in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\nDALLAS, Nov. 11, 2024 \u2014 Women were less likely than men to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in public, however, this disparity improved when 911 telecommunicators provided lifesaving instructions to callers seeking help for someone having a cardiac arrest, according to preliminary research to be presented at the American Heart Association's Resuscitation Science Symposium 2024. The meeting will be held Nov. 16-17, 2024, at the Hilton Chicago Hotel in Chicago and will feature the most recent advances related to treating cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury.\nCardiac arrest, which occurs when the heart malfunctions and abruptly stops beating, is often fatal without quick medical attention such as CPR to increase blood flow to the heart and brain. More than 357,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests happen each year in the U.S. with a 9.3% survival rate.[1] In this study, researchers identified nearly 2,400 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) from 2022 to 2023. They examined differences between women and men receiving bystander CPR and time measures, including time to recognize the need for CPR and time to first compression.\nThe study found: When a telecommunicator provided assistance to a caller by instructing them on how to perform CPR, bystander CPR was given to women 44% of the time and 40% of the time to men, compared to 9% for women and 11% for men when there was no telecommunicator assistance.\nThese differences by sex in receiving bystander CPR were not statistically significant, indicating there was no substantial difference between men and women. However, they do showcase the crucial role of the support given by a telecommunicator on the phone during a cardiac emergency.\n\"CPR can double an individual's chance of survival,\" said Audrey Blewer, Ph.D., M.P.H., the study's lead author and an assistant professor in the departments of family medicine and community health and population health sciences in the Schools of Medicine and the School of Nursing at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \"The findings from our research are consistent with similar results from a study conducted in Korea. Previous research has shown that hesitance may be a reason women are less likely than men to receive CPR in public. Some of the concerns identified were concerns about touching a woman's chest during the lifesaving technique or fear the action could be perceived as assault.\"\nBlewer noted their most recent findings help support the idea that there is a need for more advocacy to support community emergency response, and the role of the telecommunicator is critical and could be instrumental in reducing known sex disparities. This study highlights the importance of the first link in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest chain of survival \u2014 activation of the emergency response system.\nThe analysis also found: Bystander CPR was administered in 52% of cardiac arrests occurring outside of a hospital. Of these cases, 81% were performed with telecommunicator assistance compared to 19% were provided without assistance.\nThe median time from call received to the telecommunicator recognizing the need for CPR was 87 seconds (one minute and 27 seconds) for both women and men.\nThe median time to first compression from the time the telecommunicator received the call was 204 seconds (three minutes and 24 seconds) for women, compared to 207 seconds (three minutes and 27 seconds) for men.\n\"Everyone who experiences a cardiac arrest should have an equal opportunity to receive CPR,\" Blewer said. \"We are doing everything we can to research ways to address this known inequity affecting women. We hope that our research will help close this gap in the future. Most importantly, our findings prove if anyone encounters a person in cardiac arrest, it is important that they call 911 immediately and push hard and fast on the center of the person's chest.\"\n\"Taking action will help raise awareness, increase bystander CPR and improve survival from cardiac arrest,\" she said.\nA limitation of the study is that it is a secondary analysis of a larger, ongoing clinical trial, which minimized its sample size. There is a limit in generalizability because the data is from North Carolina, findings may be different for people living in other states.\nStudy details and background: Among people whose cardiac arrest cases were examined, the average age was 63 years old, 67% were white and 37% were women.\nThe study used data from the Randomized Cluster Evaluation of Cardiac Arrest Systems, a seven-year trial led by the Duke Clinical Research Institute focused on improving outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims.\nThe trial collected information for 8,839 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases from July 2022 through December 2023 covering 52 North Carolina counties, about half of the state.\nResearchers identified 2,398 of the cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests for their analysis, after excluding pediatric, traumatic and health care facility cardiac arrests and those witnessed by emergency medical services.\nCo-authors, disclosures and funding sources are listed in the manuscript.\nStatements and conclusions of studies that are presented at the American Heart Association's scientific meetings are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect the Association's policy or position.

        "summary": "The Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC), the world's single most successful athletic fundraiser, has announced a $75 million gift for cancer research, treatment, and patient care at the top-ranked Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. This year's record gift was revealed at the PMC's One in a Billion Celebration at MGM Music Hall at Fenway in Boston, Massachusetts, on Saturday evening. PMC riders, volunteers, donors, and corporate partners celebrated the organization's 2024 gift and lifetime fundraising - since 1980, the PMC has donated $1.047 billion to Dana-Farber's fight against cancer.\n\"This year's PMC gift marks an incredible milestone in its 45-year history. The credit goes to everyone who has committed to this iconic event since 1980,\" said Billy Starr, PMC founder and executive director. \"We have demonstrated the impact cycling and fundraising together can achieve, but our work is not done. We're setting our sights on the next billion as we pedal Closer by the Mile toward a world without cancer.\"\nThe PMC is Dana-Farber's largest single contributor, accounting for 66 percent of its Jimmy Fund's annual revenue. The Jimmy Fund is comprised of community-based fundraising events and other programs that solely and directly benefit Dana-Farber.\nFor the 18th consecutive year, 100 percent of every rider-raised dollar directly supports lifesaving cancer research, treatment, and care at Dana-Farber. The PMC's philanthropic support has enabled Dana-Farber to make a substantive contribution to more than half of FDA-approved cancer drugs in the United States from 2018-2022, grow its clinical trials program into one of the nation's largest, and build new world-class patient care facilities, significantly expanding the reach of the Institute.\n\"I am deeply grateful to the PMC, our steadfast partner, for supporting our work to advance cancer research and treatment,\" said Benjamin L. Ebert, MD, PhD, president and CEO of Dana-Farber. \"As a six-year PMC rider myself, I share the excitement of all the participants and appreciate the community of supporters that the PMC has created. And as a researcher, I see the impact on research and patient care from funds raised by this community every day.\"\nDuring PMC Ride Weekend in August, 6,800 riders and 3,500 volunteers rallied together from around the world to be \"One in a Billion,\" cycling up to 211 miles across Massachusetts to fundraise for this year's gift. In addition to PMC Ride Weekend, the critical funds donated this year were raised through other \"spokes in the wheel\" including: the PMC Winter Cycle, a charitable spin event at Fenway Park; PMC Unpaved, now the most successful gravel cycling fundraiser in the country; and PMC Kids Rides, mini bike-a-thons that give children an opportunity to be involved in the fight against cancer.\nThe PMC is co-presented by the Red Sox Foundation\u00ae and M&T Bank.

        "summary": "Today, we know of more than 5,000 exoplanets : planets outside our solar system that orbit other stars. While the effort to discover new worlds goes on, we're steadily learning more about the exoplanets we've already detected: their sizes, what they're made of and whether they have atmospheres. Agnibha Banerjee\nPhD Student, The Open University\nOur team has now provided tentative evidence for a sulphur-rich atmosphere on a world that's 1.5 times the size of Earth and located 35 light years away. If confirmed, it would be the smallest known exoplanet with an atmosphere. The potential presence of the gases sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082) and hydrogen sulphide (H\u2082S) in this atmosphere hint at a molten or volcanic surface.\nIn our solar system, we have two distinct categories of planets - the small rocky ones, including Earth and Mars, and the gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn. However, exoplanets span a great spectrum of sizes. Our solar system lacks a planet whose size falls into the range between Earth and Neptune, but it turns out that's the most common type of planet we have seen around other stars in our galaxy.\nThe ones closer to Neptune's size are called sub-Neptunes and the ones closer to Earth's size are called super-Earths . L 98-59 d is a super-Earth, slightly bigger and heavier than the Earth. The composition of the atmospheres of these planets is still an open question, one that we are only starting to explore with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in 2021.\nL 98-59 d was discovered in 2019 with Nasa's Tess space telescope . Most exoplanets, including L 98-59 d, have been detected using the \"transit method\" . This measures the tiny dips in starlight when the planet passes in front of the star. This dip is more pronounced for larger planets and enables us to figure out the size of a planet.\nEven JWST can't separate these tiny planets from their host stars - as they orbit their stars too closely. But there is a way to \"see\" the planet's atmosphere from this entangled light. When a planet passes in front of its star, some of the starlight filters through a planet's atmosphere, hitting the gas molecules or atoms present there, on its way to us on Earth.\nEvery gas modifies the light in its own signature manner. From the light we receive from that star system, we can infer what the composition of that atmosphere might be. This is called transmission spectroscopy , a proven technique that has previously been used to confirm the presence of CO\u2082 in an exoplanet's atmosphere.\nI am part of an international team of scientists who used JWST to observe one transit of L 98-59 d across the disc of its host star. We then obtained the transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of the exoplanet from these observations. This spectrum hinted at the possible presence of an atmosphere filled with sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide .\nThis discovery was surprising, as it stands out in stark contrast to the atmospheres of rocky planets in our own solar system, where water vapour and carbon dioxide are much more prevalent. Earth's atmosphere, for example, is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapour. Meanwhile, Venus has a thick atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide. Even Mars has a thin atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide.\nWe then used computer models that incorporate our understanding of planetary atmospheres and the light coming from L 98-59 d to come up with a potential picture of the composition of this planet's atmosphere. The absence of common gases such as carbon dioxide and the presence of SO\u2082 and H\u2082S suggests an atmosphere shaped by entirely different processes to those we're familiar with in our solar system. This hints at unique and extreme conditions on L 98-59 d, such as a molten or volcanic surface.\nAdditional observations will be necessary to confirm the presence of these gases. JWST observations had previously spotted signs of SO\u2082 on an exoplanet, but this was a gas giant, not a potentially rocky world such as L 98-59 d. Exo-volcanoes?\nThe potential presence of SO\u2082 and H\u2082S raises questions about their origin. One explosive possibility is volcanism driven by tidal heating , much like what is observed on Jupiter's moon Io . The gravitational pull of the host star on this planet stretches and squeezes it as it goes along its orbit. This motion can heat up the centre of the planet, melting its interiors and producing extreme volcanic eruptions and possibly even oceans of magma.\nCombined with its close proximity to the star (one year on this planet is seven and half Earth days), truly hellish temperatures can be reached on the surface. If future observations support the presence of such an atmosphere, not only would it be the smallest exoplanet to have a detected atmosphere, but also a crucial step towards understanding the nature of such planets.\nDetecting atmospheres on small, rocky planets is exceptionally difficult, as the planets are very small compared to the host stars, and also as intense radiation from their host stars often strips the atmospheres away. These observations, while tantalising, are only from a single transit. That means instrumental noise and other factors prevent us from making statistically strong claims. Future JWST observations will be key in confirming or refuting our analysis.\nL 98-59 d may not be a candidate for life as we know it, but studying its sulphurous atmosphere and potential volcanism provides valuable insight into worlds around other stars. Extreme worlds like these help us understand the diversity of planetary evolution across the galaxy.\nAgnibha Banerjee receives funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and The Open University.",
